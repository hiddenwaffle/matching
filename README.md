## Challenges

* Modifying elements of an array during `setTimeout()` can be tricky because user actions could have modified elements of the same array in a different `setTimeout()` call.
  * Workaround: Move the element accesses to a `useEffect()` and have the `setTimeout()` modify a (potentially arbitrary) value that the `useEffect()` is watching.
* Mobile CSS is chaotic and unpredictable

## Deploy

## Why React?

I needed to refresh my memory after having not used it for several years. It would have been better to use Canvas for an app like this.
